              The artificial intelligence landscape in 2024 represents a pivotal moment in technological advancement. 
              As we navigate through this transformative era, AI has moved beyond experimental stages to become a 
              fundamental driver of innovation across industries.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Current Market Dynamics</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The AI market has experienced unprecedented growth, with enterprise adoption reaching new heights. 
              Organizations are no longer asking whether to implement AI, but rather how to do it effectively and 
              responsibly. The focus has shifted from proof-of-concepts to production-ready solutions that deliver 
              measurable business value.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Key Trends Shaping 2024</h2>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">1. Generative AI Revolution</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Large language models and generative AI have captured mainstream attention, transforming how we 
              interact with technology. From content creation to code generation, these models are becoming 
              integral to business operations across sectors.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. AI Democratization</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              The barrier to entry for AI implementation has significantly lowered. No-code and low-code AI 
              platforms are enabling non-technical users to build and deploy AI solutions, accelerating adoption 
              across organizations of all sizes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Edge AI and IoT Integration</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              AI processing is moving closer to data sources, enabling real-time decision-making and reducing 
              latency. This trend is particularly significant for industries requiring immediate responses, 
              such as autonomous vehicles and smart manufacturing.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. Responsible AI and Ethics</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              As AI becomes more pervasive, there's growing emphasis on ethical considerations, bias mitigation, 
              and responsible deployment. Organizations are implementing AI governance frameworks to ensure 
              their systems are fair, transparent, and accountable.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Industry Impact</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
